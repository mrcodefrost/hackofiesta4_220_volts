Currently, there is a lot of talk about good fitness and how it promotes both health and mindfulness. However this trend is more targeted towards the youth and the elderly are neglected in the programs that the current Fitness Apps on various platforms offer. They do not have specific plans which are senior citizen friendly. 

Elder Gym is a cross platform app which provides the users (in this case the elderly) with exercising across various categories such as Light Cardio, Light Weight Training, Pilates, Yoga, Meditation etc. 
The app is designed to have a very simple and user friendly UI to promote better adoption by the elder community.
